Module 2 Challenge Script
The VBA code and screenshots proving the code works are attached to this respository. This code determines how long the data set is (rows) and iterates that many times.
As long as the stock code is the same, the code will collect the yearly price change coloring green for a positive change and red for a negative change.
It also collects the percent change and the total volume of sales in that year.
As a bonus, it will also determine the greatest percent increase and decrease across all stocks and the greatest volume.
